# Handtrack-App
hand tracking app build with handtrack.js 🖐️

A simple application that uses your webcam to capture any hand movements in frame. When a hand is detected, a notification will alert you! 

Practical uses? Not many. Maybe you chew your fingers and need to be help accountable? Maybe you pick your nose? Rub your eyes? idk.
